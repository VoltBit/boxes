This is a special box. It is not intended to be a container or helm chart. It
is a collection of commands, configs, scripts used to setup the basics of my
personal workstation.

I intend to use this box to quickly setup a new dektop/laptop machine the I am
going to use for development.
Initially only intended for Linux.
